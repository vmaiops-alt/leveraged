# LEVERAGED

> Leveraged Yield Farming Platform with up to 5x Leverage

## What is LEVERAGED?

**LEVERAGED** is a decentralized leveraged trading platform built on BNB Smart Chain (BSC). It enables users to amplify their exposure to crypto assets like BTC, ETH, and BNB with up to **5x leverage** while featuring a revolutionary fee model.

Unlike traditional leveraged trading platforms that charge funding rates or high trading fees, LEVERAGED only charges **25% of your value increase** when you close a profitable position. If your position is at a loss, you pay nothing.

## Why LEVERAGED?

### 🚀 Simple Leverage

No complicated perpetuals or funding rates. Just deposit stablecoins, choose your leverage (1x-5x), and get exposure to your chosen asset.

### 💰 Fair Fee Model

Traditional platforms charge you regardless of whether you win or lose. We only take a cut when you profit.
