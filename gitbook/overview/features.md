# Key Features

## 🚀 Leveraged Exposure

Get up to **5x exposure** to your favorite crypto assets without the complexity of perpetual futures.

### How It Works

1. Deposit USDT as collateral
2. Choose your leverage (1x to 5x)
3. Select your asset (BTC, ETH, BNB)
4. Your position tracks the asset's price movements

### Example

| Your Deposit | Leverage | Total Exposure | Asset |
|--------------|----------|----------------|-------|
| $1,000 | 3x | $3,000 | BTC |

If BTC goes up 10%, your position gains 30% ($300).
